# Angular2Widgets

## Purpose
This is a proof-of-concept project that loads a single instance of Angular2, while allowing you to build and render Angular2 components and place them outside of the Angular2 application root, ultimately allowing you to create Angular2 widgets available to static multipage or single page web pages.

The use case for a solution like this is for allowing developers to add Angular2 components to a Wordpress or similar site, much like a widget or series of widgets that are still capable of sharing services and communicating with each other.

This project uses Angular Cli. 

## Install
